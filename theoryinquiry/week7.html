          <h2>Instagram's Logo as a Simulation</h2>
          <p>
            This week our group had a discussion virtually through discord voice chat since one member was away from Richmond. Prior to the discussion, each of us came prepared with one example of simulation - VCU’s Rodney the Ram which is an imitation of a ram, Instagram’s camera logo that gradually changed overtime, and the reproduced versions of the Mona Lisa painting. Of all examples, we found the instagram logo interesting because it related to both simulation and skeuomorphism.
          </p>
          <p>
            In 2010, Instagram’s logo was a natural imitation of a polaroid camera. It looked more like a hyper-realistic image of a camera than a logo. Also, the polaroid logo didn’t carry a strong brand image yet because of Instagram’s newness. For those who first encountered the logo back then might’ve perceived nothing more than an imitation of a polaroid camera. 
          </p>
          <p>
            As the number of users increased, the logo had productive copies. More and more people were exposed to the logo as friends and families downloaded Instagram - The app’s icon on a friend’s phone was a productive copy of the same icon in my phone. How well the logo imitated a camera was irrelevant. The logo also got a skeuomorphism appearance in 2011, slowly disconnecting from what it originally imitated - a polaroid camera. 
          </p>
          <p>
            In 2016 came out the current version of the logo. It now has a flat design, with minimalistic circular shapes and rounded square borders. This is a copy of a copy of the original logo which well imitated a polaroid camera. The logo today is a simulacrum of a polaroid camera. It still simulates a polaroid’s appearance, but it’s something else now - We don’t immediately see a camera from it but instead the Instagram brand.
