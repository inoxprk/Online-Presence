          <h2>The Three-Dots - "Symbol"</h2>
          <p>The three-dotted menu icon has few other names - a ‘falafel icon’ or a ‘kebab icon’. If this menu button
            actually means a falafel or a kebab, it would be sound to call it an ‘icon’. The three vertically-arranged
            dots
            have a similar physical appearance of a kebab or a falafel, a food in a ball-form (like three kebab
            meatballs
            on
            a skewer). The only problem is, it doesn’t really mean kebab or falafel. When users see this button on the
            web,
            they usually interpret it as “click to expand and see the menu.” This meaning isn’t inherent to the sign but
            is
            something conventionalized through repeated use by users and designers. Thus, it’s rather correct to call it
            a
            three-dotted menu symbol than an icon.

          <h2>The Telephone Handset - "Symbolic Icon"</h2>
          <p>In the previous text I called this sign a ‘telephone symbol’. I also described how well it imitates the
            physical form of a real telephone handset. Thus this sign should be called a telephone ‘icon’ unlike the
            kebab
            icon. However, it depends on the point of view. If kindergarteners who only experienced rectangular mobile
            phones saw this sign, they might have wondered how this sign possibly means a telephone. For them, it would
            be
            a
            ‘telephone symbol’ as they have to learn the meaning. On the other hand, older generations can infer the
            meaning
            from its appearance. Perhaps a symbolic icon is a more proper category for the sign.

          <h2>The Bus - "Iconic Index"</h2>
          <p>This bus sign can be an icon, and an index. First, it’s an icon because it imitates the front profile of an
            actual bus. The sign being an icon is pretty self explanatory and relatively less complex compared to the
            telephone sign. After all, modern buses haven’t significantly changed in their look. Lastly, it can be an
            index
            based on the context. The sign is installed on top of a poll, next to a public road. By looking at the bus
            icon,
            the road, and possibly other buses with the same purple color moving around, the bus sign collectively
            indicates
            “this is where a bus will stop”. It is similar to a single thread of smoke in a forest, which may indicate
            not
            only fire but potential survivors lost in the woods.
