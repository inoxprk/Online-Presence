          <h2>Design Theory - My Understanding, Experience, & Expectations (28/08/2021)</h2>
          <p>I currently understand design theory as ways of solving problems. Of the problems, I’m specifically imagining graphic design problems. However, the term ‘design theory’ appears abstract yet. Given that my current understanding of it is roughly on the right track, I believe that I subconsciously experienced design theory pretty much whenever I had a chance to design.
          </p>
          <p>
            I previously had an opportunity to design an insignia for one of the Army’s field artillery units. The problem I began with was thinking about how to symbolize ‘field artillery unit’ graphically. I referenced other field artillery units and thought about how their insignia resembled ‘field artillery’ without explicitly telling who they were. I was thinking about symbols that had a shared meaning of ‘field artillery unit’, how that symbol was created, and how it can be utilized for the insignia design. If my understanding is right, I believe that I might’ve been using design theories during the problem-solving process. 
          </p>
          <p>
            As I have stated, design theory appears new to me but I feel like it was always there whenever I designed something. I’d like to describe myself currently as an unstructured designer. Thus, I’m expecting myself to be a more structured designer from this class. My current understanding of design theory may be wrong or right, but I believe I’ll have a better definition of it at the end.
