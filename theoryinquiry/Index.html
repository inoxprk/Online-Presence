          <div class="text">
            <p>The three-dotted menu icon is a common UX/UI element you encounter on websites or apps. It is composed of
              three dots aligned vertically, and commonly represents a ‘menu tab’ that shows additional links or options
              when clicked. Its appearance is very abstract, unlike some other representations like a map. You can tell
              what part of the Earth a map represents at first glance, but it’s difficult to explain how the three dots
              are possibly related to a ‘menu’. However, users generally get the same idea when seeing it. It’s working
              perfectly fine to guide the users what to click to find more options. However, because of its
              abstractness, it won’t work for someone who uses the internet for the first time. Three-dotted menu icon
              is like an alphabet - Alphabet ‘P’ doesn’t really explicitly represent the mouth shape when saying ‘P’.
              Instead, the icon is complete as many people share the same meaning, thus forming a representation of a
              menu tab.

          <div class="text">
            <p>This telephone symbol was found on an elevator for an emergency contact. Sometimes, it is also found when
              receiving a phone call, or on a website for contact information. It specifically represents the handset
              part of a telephone with the mic on the bottom and speaker on the top. Because the handset itself has a
              very simple shape, the telephone symbol doesn’t really go off from how an actual handset looks like.
              However, the classic handset telephones are no longer common as smartphones in 2021. Although it
              represents a ‘handset’ fairly well, perhaps it now should appear rectangular to represent the present-day
              mobile phones to narrate ‘contact info’. Possibly, a younger generation could also say that the handset
              symbol is a wrong representation in the first place as it misses the “dial body” of the telephone
              (whatever the actual name is). Regardless, I have not seen anyone having a hard time understanding what
              the symbol means yet. So far, I believe the symbol still works to convey its proper meaning.

          <div class="text">
            <p>Anyone who finds this bus symbol will quickly understand that it is a bus stop. The symbol represents the
              front profile of a bus and emphasizes that it is a public bus by including what seems to be a display
              panel on top of the windshield. It is very much a simplified representation of an actual bus with
              headlights marked by two white dots and no number plate or windshield wiper shown. However, it hardly
              misinforms the actual appearance of a bus as people always observe a real bus as it soon arrives at the
              stop. This contrasts to the case of the Mercator projection, since it’s relatively difficult to observe or
              imagine how a flattened-out Earth would look like. Furthermore, the shape of the bus has not largely
              changed like how the telephone did. Thus a representational symbol of a bus seems unlikely to change in
              the near future compared to a telephone.
