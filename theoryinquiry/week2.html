          <h2>The Three-Dots</h2>
          <p>The three-dotted menu icon is a common UX/UI element you encounter on websites or apps. It is composed of three dots aligned vertically, and commonly represents a ‘menu tab’ that shows additional links or options when clicked. Its appearance is very abstract, unlike some other representations like a map. You can tell what part of the Earth a map represents at first glance, but it’s difficult to explain how the three dots are possibly related to a ‘menu’. However, users generally get the same idea when seeing it. It’s working perfectly fine to guide the users what to click to find more options. However, because of its abstractness, it won’t work for someone who uses the internet for the first time. Three-dotted menu icon is like an alphabet - Alphabet ‘P’ doesn’t really explicitly represent the mouth shape when saying ‘P’. Instead, the icon is complete as many people share the same meaning, thus forming a representation of a menu tab.

          <h2>The Telephone Handset</h2>
          <p>This telephone symbol was found on an elevator for an emergency contact. Sometimes, it is also found when receiving a phone call, or on a website for contact information. It specifically represents the handset part of a telephone with the mic on the bottom and speaker on the top. Because the handset itself has a very simple shape, the telephone symbol doesn’t really go off from how an actual handset looks like. However, the classic handset telephones are no longer common as smartphones in 2021. Although it represents a ‘handset’ fairly well, perhaps it now should appear rectangular to represent the present-day mobile phones to narrate ‘contact info’. Possibly, a younger generation could also say that the handset symbol is a wrong representation in the first place as it misses the “dial body” of the telephone (whatever the actual name is). Regardless, I have not seen anyone having a hard time understanding what the symbol means yet. So far, I believe the symbol still works to convey its proper meaning.

          <h2>The Bus</h2>
          <p>Anyone who finds this bus symbol will quickly understand that it is a bus stop. The symbol represents the front profile of a bus and emphasizes that it is a public bus by including what seems to be a display panel on top of the windshield. It is very much a simplified representation of an actual bus with headlights marked by two white dots and no number plate or windshield wiper shown. However, it hardly misinforms the actual appearance of a bus as people always observe a real bus as it soon arrives at the stop. This contrasts to the case of the Mercator projection, since it’s relatively difficult to observe or imagine how a flattened-out Earth would look like. Furthermore, the shape of the bus has not largely changed like how the telephone did. Thus a representational symbol of a bus seems unlikely to change in the near future compared to a telephone.
