          <p>
            The grade I want to receive is an ‘A’. The grade implies qualitative instead of quantitative performance. At the core, a continuously developing yet more rigid understanding of design theory, critical thinking, and visual culture should be achieved for this grade. Works from this class will be assessed by participation, process, and execution. The progress over the semester will be assessed by comparing the progressive quality of works submitted. 
          </p>
          <p>
            For work participation, all work should be submitted by the deadline, but most importantly be allocated with at least 6 hours a week. Rushing will likely cause missing the important part of this course - thinking and rethinking. Also, interaction with at least one peer should be made - sharing perspectives for critical thinking is a requirement. At the same time, ‘peers’ are not limited to students within the cohort. I should keep in mind people outside of the graphic design department provide a valuable point of view too. 
          </p>
          <p>
            For the work process: Observation, researching evidence, and critical thinking should take place. Conclusions should ultimately well-reflect this work process and be re-evaluated. Re-evaluating should take account of different perspectives. 
          </p>
          <p>
            For work execution, the web for online presence should be created from my own design and codes instead of using a web editor service. By doing so, the web will serve as a site to implement and reflect what I learned and developed throughout the semester. Craftsmanship and presentation will be assessed based on the web’s progressive improvements observed from one after another.
          </p>
          <p>
            At the end of the semester, I should be able to restate a well-developed understanding of Design Theory which should be comparable to what's been stated in the first writing response submitted in the beginning of the semester.
