          <p>
            It was an interesting practice to do nothing. The beginning was very simple - I sat, put my phone away, and
            just stayed seated. Then came the urge to deal with the time somehow. Because I can’t be sleeping, walking
            around the house, or listening to music, I just kept thinking. I thought about things like what I should be
            thinking, or whether thinking itself is perhaps another form of distraction. To describe doing nothing, it
            was a fight against the urge to do something. At one point, I couldn’t resist thinking about “so.. What’s
            the point of doing nothing?” because doing nothing seemingly felt like a waste of time. However, I think
            even that was another important part of the doing nothing process.

            In the end, I did nothing for 20 minutes. It was a short moment of separation from my daily life and forcing
            myself to think in the “third space”. I usually pay attention to events happening around me - school,
            friends, jobs, etc. Other matters were more of a distraction. I thought it was a valuable opportunity to
            change my perspective, and give attention to what I used to consider a distraction.
