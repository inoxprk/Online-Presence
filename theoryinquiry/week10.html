              <li>
                <p><span style="font-size: 1.5em;">Place:</span> Kemper Street, Jacqueline Street, and S. Allen Avenue that surrounds my house back and front.</p>

              <li>
                <p><span style="font-size: 1.5em;">The Buildings:</span> There are only residential buildings around here. They’re all 2-story houses with brick foundations. Most houses have dark grey roofs with calm, beige walls. It’s as if the same architect designed the houses in this area. The coherence of the houses in this area distinguishes this neighbourhood with the other but makes it difficult to differentiate each resident’s homes. The experience is similar to seeing doors on an apartment hallway - without the room numbers on the door, it’s difficult to distinguish which room is which. This includes my home located among them. One notable feature for some houses are the pumpkins and fake webs. Although Halloween is over, the decorations give a hint of spirituality to the street.</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p><span style="font-size: 1.5em;">The Street:</span> Kemper Street and Jacqueline Street that surround my house are both one-way. The cars are parked facing the same direction. However, you have to walk toward the opposite direction in order to go to the bus stop. This makes the car owners drive towards the West while pedestrians walk towards the East once they leave the house. It’s imaginable which direction residents without any cars will go for grocery shopping. The one-way streets lead cars to S. Allen Avenue. It is one of the main roads that lead to VCU campus or Cary town. Because S. Allen Avenue serves as the main street, it’s hard to see any cars moving around elsewhere at this time.

                <p><span style="font-size: 1.5em;">Biker’s Life:</span> There’s only one sewer drain installed in the center of Kemper Street. Because of this, the street is slightly inclined so the water can flow towards the center. The same applies to other streets. Although the slope is barely noticeable, it’s inclined enough to annoy some of the bikers. Considering that the streets are sloped upward as you leave the neighborhood, it might be hard biking to work in the morning compared to the way back home. 
                </p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p><span style="font-size: 1.5em;">Walker’s Life:</span> The neighborhood is pedestrian friendly as there’s a continuous sidewalk everywhere. One inconvenience is the trees along the sidewalks. For some reason most tree trunks are lower than average people’s height with its branches blocking the sidewalks. This forces a person to either crouch under the branches or walk around the tree. A pedestrian has to make a choice - the sidewalk without any trees and shades, or a sidewalk with trees occasionally disturbing your path.
